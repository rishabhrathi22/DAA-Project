## Python Libraries used
> random

> timeit


## About
- In this project the the concept of backtracking is used.
- The project was done in python.


## Problem Statement
- User has to provide the size of the matrix i.e. `number of rows` and `number of columns`.
- The matrix will be generated automatically using `random` library of python.
- The matrix will only contain values `1` and `0` in it. More about that below.
- To find the efficiency of the program we have used another library called `timeit`.
- We have to find all possible paths from the first cell `array[0][0]` to the last column of the matrix `array[x][n]`
- There is a condition that we can move only to the first neighbouring cell only if that cell has value `1` in it.
- If there is `0` in the neighbouring cell it means that we cannot pass through that cell, we have to take another route.
- Here another route means any neighbouring cell which mat have value `1`.
- Following this algorithm we have to calculate the number of all poassible paths from the first cell to the last column.
- Also we have to print some of the paths.
